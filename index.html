    <h3>  About Me </h3>
    <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently a                  junior at Lehigh University working towards a             B.S. in computer engineering with a minor in              entrepreneurship. I have experience programing             in several languages including java, html and              css. 
        </p>
    <p> 
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very passionate             about programming and engineering in general.             Since I was a little kid, I enjoyed taking                apart and figuring out how numerous gadets                worked. Now that I have the skills to desgin and enhance what I used to wonder, I want to apply these skills and make a difference.

    <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work well on a team and in a group environment. There have been several programming projects that I had to desing with another partner. Communicating code can be very difficult and after working on several projects, I have developed the skills to clearly present my ideas.
